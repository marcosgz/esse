# esse - ElasticSearch and OpenSearch Ruby Client

[![build](https://github.com/marcosgz/esse/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marcosgz/esse/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This gem is a Ruby simple and extremely flexible client for ElasticSearch and OpenSearch based on official clients such as [elasticsearch-ruby](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby) and [opensearch-ruby](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-ruby). It's a pure Ruby implementation, and due to its modular design, it's easy to extend and adapt to your needs. Esse extensions are available as separate gems. A few examples:

- [esse-kaminari](https://github.com/marcosgz/esse-kaminari) - Kaminari pagination support
<!-- - [esse-rails](https://github.com/marcosgz/esse-rails) - Ruby on Rails integration. It also includes the active_record extension below by default with a few extra features. -->
- [esse-active_record](https://github.com/marcosgz/esse-active_record) - ActiveRecord integration
<!-- - [esse-sequel](https://github.com/marcosgz/esse-sequel) - Sequel integration -->
